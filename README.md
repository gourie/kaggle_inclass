## step2: create your team
Each group will have to create a team using the group information provided on Toledo. 
Each group member should be added to this team to be able to jointly work on the submission notebook.

1. All group members need to join the competition and share their Kaggle accounts with **one** group member (the leader).
2. The leader creates a team using the designated group name found on Toledo .

## step3: add TAs to your team
Next, the leader should add the TAs to your team (you can find their Kaggle account and email addresses on Toledo). In 
this way, the TAs have access to your notebook and are able to grade your submission for this course project.

## step4: code and version your team notebook
Now that you are setup, your team can really start working on the assignment. 
1. The leader imports the template notebook which is shared by default with all group members.
    - create a New notebook

    - select File > Open Notebook to upload the template notebook that you downloaded from Toledo.
        ![Upload notebook](./img/kaggle_uploadnotebook.png)
    - once the template notebook has been loaded, you can change the notebook name and save a first version.
        ![Save notebook](./img/kaggle_savenotebook.png)
    - finally, share this notebook in writer mode with all the group members
        ![Save notebook](./img/kaggle_sharenotebook.png)
2. The leader will find the notebook in the Code/Your Work section and see wiht whom it's shared:
    ![Leader notebook](./img/kaggle_leader.png)
    For the other group members, the team notebook will appear in the Code/Shared With You section:
    ![Leader notebook](./img/kaggle_member.png)
3. All group members can now start working on this team notebook. Each group member will 
save his/her work in new versions of the notebook. Note that these versions cannot be merged inside kaggle so you might
want to do this manually or use another tool (e.g. git) for this operation. 

## step5: submit results
Once you are ready, you can submit your (intermediate) results to get a score on the leaderboard (the template notebook contains 
instruction details to help you with this). The TAs will use your latest results and notebook to grade your submission so please
make sure that this notebook contains your best results!

Please contact your TAs on Toledo.
