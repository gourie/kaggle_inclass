## step2: create your team
Each group will have to create a team using the group information provided on Toledo. 
Each group member should be added to this team to be able to jointly work on the submission notebook.

1. All group members need to join the competition and share their Kaggle accounts with **one** group member (the leader).
2. The leader creates a team using the designated group name found on Toledo .

    - finally, change the notebook name and save a version.
2. All group members can open the shared notebook and start working on their version of (part of) the notebook. All
members of the team can view each other's notebooks but editing will always create a new copy that needs to saved 
as a new notebook file. We recommend that you use distinct notebook filename to keep track of these different notebooks
and ensure proper submission of your final notebook in the end.
3. Once you are ready, submit the results to get a(n updated) score on the leaderboard (max 2 submissions per day allowed).

## step4: submit final results and share your notebook with TAs
To complete the assignment, each team must submit results at least once **and** share its notebook with the TAs 
(Kaggle account and email address are available on Toledo).
